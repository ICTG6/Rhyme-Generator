# Introduction

This is our first group project together, we chose to work on "Rhyme Generator". Nowadays there are different hobbies and one of those is writing lyrics and poems. This topic picked our interest on how rhyme works. Rhymes help people to express themselves in a creative way. Our target of current project is to help user in finding rhymes based on user input word and will result a list of word that rhymes with the user input.

There are a lot of rhymes pattern and our project right now will only focus on the ABAB pattern where first line will rhyme with the third line and the second line will rhyme with the fourth line, vice versa. For Example: 
		

```I've been reading books of old
	I've been reading books of old
	The legends and the myths
	The testaments they told
	The moon and its eclipse
	
	Artist: The Chainsmokers and Coldplay 
	Song: Something Just Like This```
```

## Final Thoughts

 	Our target of this project is the set up a website where people could use it to search for a rhyme of a words. We have another goal to improve our current project where instead of giving a result of a list of rhymes word based on user input, we wanted to develop it into a generator that could give output of one line that rhymes with the specific words so there will be an AI that could create and generate the one line automatically.
	Another future development that we wanted to make after the target before is achieved is to developed the AI to be able to generate a whole poem by itself by taking a view keywords as an identifier on the topic and words that wanted to be used in the Poem/Lyrics.
